Data Science – End 2 End Beginners Course
Part 1 - Machine Learning and Data Analytics

The Objective of this course is to teach students how to do an End-2-End data science project: 

  From Problem definition, data sourcing, wrangling and modelling.

  To analyzing, visualizing and deploying & maintaining the models.

This course is for anyone interested in learning data science – analyst, programmer, non-technical professional, student, etc.

The End 2 End Data science course will be divided into 4 parts: 

Part 1 is a Beginner’s course that covers Machine Learning and Data Analytics

Part 2 will cover Intermediate machine learning techniques – Deep Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing)

Part 3 will cover Data Engineering – Databases and Big Data tools (Hadoop, Spark)

Part 4 will cover Advanced machine learning techniques (Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision), Time Series Analysis and Recommender Systems

Parts 2,3,4 of the course are to be published.

Throughout the course relevant details, python code examples and online resources are provided to support the learning.
